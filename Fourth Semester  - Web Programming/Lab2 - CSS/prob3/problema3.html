                        Cappadocia is a historical region in Central Anatolia region, Turkey. It is largely in the provinces of Nevsehir, Kayseri,
                        Aksaray, Sivas.
                        According to Herodotus, in the time of the Ionian Revolt, the Cappadocians were reported as occupying a region
                        from the Taurus Mountains to the vicinity of the Euxine (Black Sea). Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in the south
                        by the chain of mountains that separate it from Cilicia, to the east by the upper Euphrates, to the north by the Pontus,
                        and to the west by Lycaonia and eastern Galatia.
                        The name, traditionally used in Christian sources throughout history, continues in use as an international tourism concept
                        to define a region of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by fairy chimneys, in addition to its
                        religious heritage of being a centre of early Christian learning, evidenced by hundreds of churches and monasteries
                        (such as those of Goreme and Ihlara), as well as underground cities that were dug to offer protection during periods of
                        persecution.
                        Facade of an ancient church, literally meaning "Open Palace", carved into the valley walls in Cappadocia.
                        Subsequent research suggests that the adverb katta meaning 'down, below' is exclusively Hittite, while its Luwian equivalent
                        is zanta. Therefore, the recent modification of this proposal operates with the Hittite katta peda-, literally
                        "place below" as a starting point for the development of the toponym Cappadocia.
                        The earlier derivation from Iranian Hu-apa-dahyu 'Land of good horses' can hardly be reconciled with the phonetic shape of
                        Kat-patuka. Several other etymologies have also been offered in the past.
                        Herodotus wrote that the name of the Cappadocians was applied to them by the Persians, while they were termed by the
                        Greeks "White Syrians" (Leucosyri), who were most probably descendants of the Hittites. One of the Cappadocian
                        tribes he mentions is the Moschoi, associated by Flavius Josephus with the biblical figure Meshech, son of Japheth:
                        "and the Mosocheni were founded by Mosoch; now they are Cappadocians".

                        Cappadocia appears in the biblical account given in the book of Acts 2:9. The Cappadocians were named as one group
                        (among "Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia") hearing the
                        Gospel account from Galileans in their own language on the day of Pentecost shortly after the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
                        Acts 2:5 states "Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven," seeming to suggest
                        that some of the Cappadocians were Jews, or part of the diaspora of Jews present in Jerusalem at the time.
                        The region is also mentioned in the Jewish Mishnah, in Ketubot 13:11, and in several places in the Talmud, including
                        Yevamot 121a, Hullin 47b.
                        Under the later kings of the Persian Empire, the Cappadocians were divided into two satrapies, or governments, with
                        one comprising the central and inland portion, to which the name of Cappadocia continued to be applied by Greek geographers,
                        while the other was called Pontus. This division had already come about before the time of Xenophon. As after the fall of
                        the Persian government the two provinces continued to be separate, the distinction was perpetuated, and the name Cappadocia
                        came to be restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), which alone will be the focus of this
                        article.
                        The kingdom of Cappadocia still existed in the time of Strabo as a nominally independent state. Cilicia was the name
                        given to the district in which Caesarea, the capital of the whole country, was situated. The only two cities of
                        Cappadocia considered by Strabo to deserve that appellation were Caesarea (originally known as Mazaca) and Tyana, not
                        far from the foot of the Taurus.
